Q.2 Answer:

Java is a high-level language. i.e it is a language that was created to simplify computer programming. It is english-like and thus, easy to grasp for us humans. 
But Computers are not able to read this language. 
For the instructions written in java code to be executed, the code has to be first translated to machine language i.e conversion to binary form. 

A program written in java code is called the source program or source code. 
To translate this source code into machine language an interpretor or compiler is necessary.

Interpretor and compiler are both programming tools used for translation of high-level langauages into machine language. 
They are able to read and translate source code into binary output, and then execute it.

Interpretation and compilation though similar have differences to each other.

In interpretation, the interpreter reads one statement from the source code at a time, and translates it to machine code immediately.
It proceeds to execute the code right after the translation of a single statement. 

In compilation, the compiler reads the entire source code and then translates it to a machine-code file. This machine-code file is then
executed by a executor.
